## About The Project

[![Preview image](preview.png)](https://calc.deithy.me/)

The algorithm for calculating recruitments points can be confusing and has some grey areas that are not
well documented, not to mention that one can only see his score after selecting the study field. This
project aims to fix that issue by allowing future students to fill their scores globally and see
all the scores before selecting study fields.
